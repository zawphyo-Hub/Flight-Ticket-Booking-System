|------|----|------|-------|
| Bangkok (Thailand) | Yangon (Myanmar) | 2024-Nov-11 | Economy |
| Yangon (Myanmar) | Bangkok (Thailand) | 2024-Nov-17 | Economy |
| Osaka (Japan) | Seoul (Korea) | 2024-Nov-02 | Business |
| Seoul (Korea) | Osaka (Japan) | 2024-Nov-07 | Business |
| Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) | Surabaya (Indonesia) | 2024-Nov-08 | Economy |

### Round-Trip Tickets
| From | To | Depart Date | Return Date | Class |
|------|----|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Bangkok(Thailand) | Yangon(Myanmar) | 2024-Nov-11 | 2024-Nov-17 | Economy |

## üìö Lessons Learned
- Gained hands-on experience with PHP backend development and MySQL integration using PhpMyAdmin.
- Learned how to use PHP's echo statements effectively to display dynamic content like flight schedules.
- Understood how to pass parameters between pages as I need to carry the data that users enter to search flights to different pages.
- Developed a admin functionalities such as Add, Update, Delete using PHP.

## ‚ùå Mistakes Made
- Initially struggled with passing parameters across different pages, especially maintaining selected flight data.
- Did not structure PHP files in a modular way, which made the code harder to manage as the project grew.

## Final Thoughts
Sky Asia Express was built as a portfolio-level project to demonstrate full-stack web development skills. It simulates the workflow of actual airline booking systems while offering a smooth interface for both users and admins.
