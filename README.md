This project features an advanced flight search functionality, allowing users to filter results by departure time, destination, passenger numbers, flight class, and trip type (one-way or round trip). It simulates the behavior of real-world flight booking websites, ensuring that users can find and book flights efficiently.

The system is integrated with PhpMyAdmin to manage the flight schedules and passenger information, ensuring that the booking process is powered by a robust database.
